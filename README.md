KbHelper in utils:
In utility kbhelper provide the utils as follows:
 1. Convert from YAML format to JSON format
 2. Convert from JSON format to YAML format
 3. Clean a text file from windows line endings (if CR + LF is found, it is replaced with LF)
 4. Add a line to the file if it is not present in the file yet
 5. On the basis of list of pods from kubernetes (or openshift), generates a cmd.file working
   with this pod.

Geolocation:
Suppose you get a database of IP codes in csv format from http://lite.ip2location.com
1. Utility csvtobin can compress those csv files to necessary minimum binary form 
(only 2 columns: ip and country code), both for IP4 and IP6. 
The generated binary files are called ip4.bin, ip6.bin
2. Utility iptonumber can translate IP4/IP6 address to binary form and present it
as either decimal or hex number. And also it can make back conversion.
3. Utility ipsearch can search by IP (either IP4/IP6) and find the country code using
the ip4.bin and ip6.bin files generated by the utility csvtobin mentioned above.
